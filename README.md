1) Case study

Accurate estimation of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is a crucial factor for sustainable forest management and mitigating climate change. Satellite Remote sensing technology has proved to be an effective method in large scale forest monitoring as well as forest biomass estimation. In this study, focus has been given for a remote sensing approach for estimate the above-ground biomass of the western Tiger Landscape of Nepal using Radar and Optical remote sensing data.

The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of the RF regression algorithm for radar ,optical, and combination of radar and optical data for predicting the forest biomass and test the performance of the RF regression models. In this process ALOS PALSAR radar backscatter, radar texture parameters, Vegetation indexes form Landsat 5TM optical data, and digital elevation model data were taken into the random forest algorithm to predict the results.
